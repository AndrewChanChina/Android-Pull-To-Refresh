A container for a ListView that you can pull to refresh.

Current Status: Buggy.
There are two currently known bugs.
1. When this view is first drawn, the list does not fill the container. This results in the entire header showing. Not so bad, but not great. Not something I would put in a publicly released app.
2. Sometimes, the refresh header will show itself. Not sure why. This needs to be fixed.

Background:
It seems that there are two ways you can do this. One is to use a header in a ListView, and the other is to put a ListView and another View in a ScrollView. This uses the second method. An example of the first method can be found in Johan Nilsson's widget at https://github.com/johannilsson/android-pulltorefresh
